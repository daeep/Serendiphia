Serendiphia comes from the word Serendipity whose meaning catches us with that touch of mystery and surprise. It is charged with positive energy and stealthily emerges in our lives to show us something that we did not see but that we appreciate for the well-being and fascination that it transmits to us.

Undoubtedly, serendipities are gifts that come at the right time so as not to leave us indifferent. Therefore, let's not miss out on the small details around us because at any moment, they can surprise us.
