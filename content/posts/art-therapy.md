## Art Therapy
Art Therapy is a type of psychotherapy that uses artistic media to help people explore their thoughts and emotions in a unique manner. 

According to a 2014 World Health Organization report one  in every eight people in the world live with a mental disorder, these mental disorders involve significant disturbances in thinking, emotional regulation, or behavior like depression or Anxiety.

Oscar Wilde once said, “Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.” Art provides a way to communicate experiences when individuals lack verbal skills or when words are insufficient. Humans evolved artistic expression as an imaginative tool for adapting to changing conditions and solving problems.

This therapy relies not on theory but on practice and uses objects such as brushes and paper. This helps people to feel more connected with the world around them and use art as the principal means of communication.
Besides helping individuals with mental health issues, Art Therapy can be beneficial to a great number of people like: little children, elderly men and women, teenagers or just people who feel depressed. You don’t need to have experience with art or a special ability, your work won’t be criticized; it’s all about the expressed emotions and experimenting the whole process.
