## Creating art, finding healingâ€¦


<img src="/img/heart.jpeg" alt="Heart" width="300"/>


The discovery of creating through art heals and transforms you. Art that does not heal is not art.

The perception of art moves us, drives us, and awakens desire, emotion, admiration, and longing. It mobilizes our thinking and feeling, stimulates reflection, which is the path to wisdom, and elevated emotions, which are the path to generosity and inspiration.

The emotions captured from art can even break our perceptual and mental schemes, open up possibilities, break false impossibilities, and invite us to travel through the unknown to reach what we long for within a journey towards ourselves.
