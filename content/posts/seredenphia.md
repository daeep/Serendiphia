Surely more than once something has come into your life that you did not expect but that has been a great discovery for you. It may even be a person who, without knowing how or when, was able to unexpectedly turn your life around.

The point is that it arrived without warning but it was so fascinating that you don't even believe it could have happened. Sometimes surprises exist in the form of serendipity.

In fact, many of the great discoveries that have been discovered throughout history have been the result of this striking and peculiar phenomenon, especially in the field of science.

Have you ever experienced this?.
